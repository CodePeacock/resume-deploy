    skills, experience, and suitability for job roles.

-   Cultivated strong relationships with potential candidates to ensure
    a robust talent pipeline.

-   Logged all candidate information, resumes, and communication
    transcripts, and properly documented and organized them in the
    Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

-   Worked with senior recruiters, account managers, and other team
    members to meet recruitment goals and objectives.

-   Designed and maintained a reliable Flask application for handling
    asynchronous tasks, allowing for smooth PDF uploads and effective
    information extraction from both files and URLs. Used regular
    expressions, machine learning techniques, and asynchronous
    programming to enhance text processing, data extraction, and storage
    in JSON format, with support for external API interactions. The
    application worked on resumes with linear formats (one column)
    **with 95% extraction accuracy as well as non-linear formats (two
    column or tabular) PDFs, achieving 90% extraction accuracy.**

-   Created a virtual glasses app with TensorFlow and Keras,
    incorporating CNN and GAN models, and improved performance through
    multithreading. Employed PIL for image pre-processing, SocketIO for
    real-time communication, and OpenCV for image manipulation and
    landmark detection. The entire system implemented detection of
    facial landmarks to bound glasses around eyes, below eyebrows, while
    user moves around; system working at 100% capacity given user's
    camera is of high quality with colour depth

-   Developed an automated attendance system featuring real-time facial
    recognition and anti-spoofing, using Keras, OpenCV, and PyMySQL, and
    with a user interface made with the Tkinter library, resulting in a
    system that is able to **detect faces and mark attendance fast while
    checking for spoofing with 90% accurate detection of spoofs.**

-   Constructed an image stitching app with OpenCV for key-point
    matching, homography estimation, and image blending, integrating the
    final results into Google\'s Marzipano tool, **achieving 95%
    accuracy.**

-   Implemented a virtual try-on system for clothing with diffusion and
    latent diffusion models using PyTorch for neural network
    architecture and image pre-processing, and **generating images in
    less than 1 min on GPU with 5% error margin on full body clothes and
    2% margin on full sleeves**.

-   Developed a web scraper with BeautifulSoup and Pandas for data
    extraction, integrating the data into a model for analysing the
    property market, **scraping 10K records in under 25 seconds**.

-   Designed an Android app with Android Studio, and OpenCV for
    real-time wall colouring, implementing boundary recognition and
    colour application through real-time segmentation, able to colour
    walls **within 3 seconds of selecting colour**.
